    Labled Some Buttons
    Hopefully Reenabled Robot Centric (sorry Sam)

    Cleaned up some of my broken code stored in comments

    Possibly add a comments file just for giant chunks of commented code

    Plan to do more today or this weekend

    Swerve module broke :(, unverified--
        added auto paths
        changed balance arctan -> arccos because sign issues

        ** zeroed wheels in RobotContainer

        added a wait to auton

        found live share!!!!!!! :)
            basically google docs but for vscode

    ROBOT ELBOW JOINT BROKEN, MANY THINGS MAY NOT BE VERIFIED AS WORKING, WHICH IS WHY changelog.txt WAS CREATED

    New updateGripperSpeed.java -
    
        Default command for claw

        Allows for triggers to control the gripper movement, X and B buttons still move grippers via request.
        Uses direct current control, since the motors used are not Talons and WPI's talon interface is used, percent output may break motor 
        (supplies up to 40A, and the motors are rated for 12A)

    New changelog.txt -
        I added this for more verbose update logs, change if want.

    backAndForth changes-
        Made this auton code move the arm too, values in code, should still follow original path.
    
    Balance.java -
        No longer moves the robot due to its tendency to launch the robot the wrong way.
            arctan and arccos have different shapes, check desmos for differences between original arccos(f(x,y)) = 1 and arctan(g(x,y)) = 1

    Arm changes

        updateHoldPosition.java & ArmControl.java - 

            restructuring of the logic behind hold positions

            Instead of using a setpoint in the command, it updates two positions in ArmControl, which defaultArm now tries to constantly set the arm to.
            Default arm position is now (0, 75) via encoder default value changes.

            PID changed, G variable added too much complexity and made the arm motion 'break'

    Arm changes

        updateHoldPosition.java - 

            sets setpoints for arm and elbow based on parameters, in degrees

            3:1 gearbox removed from shoulder motors.
            encoder values and interpreted degree values now logged in shuffleboard.
